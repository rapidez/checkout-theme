Fast checkout experience
- Already logged in - If the user is already logged in when entering the checkout, the user enters a simplified step 2 of the checkout.
- Not logged in - If the user is not logged in when entering the checkout, we verify the e-mail that's being used on step 2 of the checkout. If the e-mail is known we provide a login screen where the user can log in to enter the simplified step 2 state.

## Installation

```
composer require rapidez/checkout-theme
```

To use the views from this package instead of the default ones, you'll need to publish the "core overwrite views" with the following command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\CheckoutTheme\ServiceProvider" --tag=core-overwrites
```

If you've already overwritten these by yourself before you installed this package, you will have to manually overwrite these as the publish command will not overwrite already existing files.

Add these colors to your `tailwind.config.js` and modify them to your liking:
(Alternatively, you could add these to a separate file and add it as a preset to your tailwind.config.js)
```
colors: {
    ct: {
        enhanced: {
            DEFAULT: '#40C42A',
        },
        inactive: {
            DEFAULT: '#8A8275',
            100: '#F6F4EE',
        },
        disabled: '#EBE8DE',
        accent: {
            DEFAULT: '#FEAB05',
        },
        primary: {
            DEFAULT: '#625B50',
        },
        border: '#EAE7DC',
        error: '#DF241D',
    },
},
```

This package also requires the `SKU` functionality to be enabled in the image resizer. This is normally enabled by default.

## Configuration

Publish the configuration file and have a look at the options `config/rapidez/checkout-theme.php`
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\CheckoutTheme\ServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

## Payment-icons

We have provided a set of payment icons for your convenience. To integrate these icons into your project and enable the functionality of adding or modifying icons, please execute the following command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\CheckoutTheme\ServiceProvider" --tag=payment-icons
```

For future deployment purposes, it might be a good idea to add this command to your composer post-autoload-dump script.

## Customizations

If you want you *could* publish the views. But it's recommended to only publish and change the views you need so when there is an update you don't have to compare all views with the new version. Also keep in mind this is an opinionated theme, if you want/need to change a lot it's better to build your own in terms of upgradability.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\CheckoutTheme\ServiceProvider" --tag=views
```
